## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bwendy, or Brendon if you care about certificates. I'm an indie game, web, & software developer.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Gladiators of Roma Revixit](https://wishlist.faraway.games), and [PyCube](https://github.com/BwendyGames/PyCube)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GDScript & Godot
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my theories
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: bwendyboo on discord, or bwendydev@proton.me
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I never learned how to a ride a bike. This was foreshadowing to the fact that I don't know how to do anything correctly. Conversely, I know how to do everything incorrectly. Everything.
