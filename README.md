## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brendon, but I go by Bwendy online. I've been making video games for my entire adolescent life up to now. In 2023, I launched Faraway Studios, what was then a parternship with my lifelong friend Fivel. There are now three/four of us (depending on the day lol). I also do some web-development, and I solo-developed the steam game RTS Football. I also like Adventure Time, a lot.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Gladiators of Roma Revixit](https://wishlist.faraway.games)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GDScript & Godot
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my theories
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: bwendyboo on discord, or bwendydev@proton.me
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I never learned how to a ride a bike. This was foreshadowing to the fact that I don't know how to do anything correctly. Conversely, I know how to do everything incorrectly. Everything.
